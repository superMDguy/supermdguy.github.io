Hi! I'm **Matthew Dangerfield**, a recent [Applied Math](https://acme.byu.edu/) grad from BYU and co-founder of [PeakSend AI](https://peaksendai.com/), an AI appointment setter.

I grew up loving math and dreaming of inventing things. In high school, I wanted to build a physical robot, but couldn't afford the parts. So I bought a cheap used laptop and decided to learn software development to fund my robot. Long story short, the robot never happened, but I fell in love with the tight feedback loop of writing code and seeing something appear on my screen. Eventually I got a part-time frontend development job, and spent a few years gradually branching out into full-stack roles at a few different startups.

In college, I chose to study Applied Math after meeting some recent grads who had really cool ML jobs with just a bachelor's degree. I loved getting to go in-depth on mathematics, and it forever changed the way I think. Everything's a vector space now! I also enjoyed getting to spend hours wrestling with really hard problems. It's deeply satisfying to discover an elegant solution to a previously inpenetrable problem.

At the same time, I always had some sort of side project going, you can see a full record [here](/projects). One of my favorite memories is the first time I made money on the internet. It blew my mind that someone _paid me_ for the project I'd come up with! I still love the feeling of working with users on products I've helped build. I hope to build many things that create real value for real people, and Iâ€™m always up for collaborating with others who feel the same.
